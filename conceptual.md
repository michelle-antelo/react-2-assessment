Answer the following questions below:

- What is the purpose of the React Router?
  - Let's us handle client and server-side routing within React.

- What is a single page application?

- How do you grab URL parameters from within a component using React Router?
  - In the URL path, you can input variables that will take you to that specific path.

- What is context in React? When would you use it?
  - Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels.

- Describe some differences between class-based components and function
  components in React.
  - The class component uses ES6 class syntax, and it extends React components with a render method that returns React elements. On the other hand, functional components with hooks are purely JavaScript functions that also return React elements. 

- What are some of the problems that hooks were designed to solve?
  - With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.
